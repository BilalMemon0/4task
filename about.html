        <h4>Air pods</h4>
        <p>AirPods are wireless headphones that connect with apple products such as iPhones, iPods, Mac Computers,
             and Apple Watches. This product consists of two white headphones that magnetically connect to a white
              pod like charger for storage and charging purposes. <br>
              After a delayed start, AirPods finally started appearing in Apple Stores this morning, and inventory 
              quickly sold out in many locations.

              Before they went on sale, we had quite a bit of information about AirPods and what they were capable 
              of doing. We knew they would pair easily, and that there were sensors built in that knew when you are
               wearing them and when you werent. But some things just have to be experienced to appreciate their magic,
                and AiPods are one of them.
              
              First, you will never see a more seamless pairing experience than the first time you pair the AirPods.
               Open the case, press Connect and they are instantly paired with all your iOS devices, including iPad and Apple Watch.
                As soon as you put one AirPod in your ear, a subtle sound lets you know they are on and ready to be used.</P>

        <p>Gain concepts central to smartwatch design, editing and animation 
            correction using the popular open source Galaxy Watch Designer 
            software package. This visual guide builds upon the essential 
            concepts of smartwatch design, decoration, digital imaging,
             animation, function integration, and visual effects, and gets
              more advanced as chapters progress, covering which digital new

               smartwatch design.
            Smart Watch Design Fundamentals also covers key factors in the data footprint optimization work process, designing and optimizing animation assets, and why these optimizations are important. Additionally, the book covers other advanced topics such as how to provide
